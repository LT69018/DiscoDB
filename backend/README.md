This will contain the backend code for DiscoDB.

I will use these emojis to talk about the status of each of these.
- ðŸŸ¢ : done
- ðŸŸ¡ : in progress
- ðŸ”´ : not started

Currently also marking priority of if we will implement this endpoint in brackets.

# Endpoints (Supported Functionality)
## ðŸŸ¡ Create/add a user (sign up) [definitely]
```
POST /add_user
- Parameters:
    - username (string)
- Expect return (json)
    {"username": username,
    "user_id": user_id,
    "message": message}
```
- **Note**: Make sure to save the `user_id`. This is required to save albums for this user.
- Todo: maybe require a password. 
    - Not a priority right now as we want to focus on functionality for a single local user.
    - i.e. just run this with a "testUser" username from frontend and save the "user_id"

Example (as of 4/24)
- Todo: replace example once our db query actually returns a user_id
```
POST localhost:8080/add_user?username=jess
=>
200 OK
{
    "username": "jess",
    "user_id": null,
    "message": "TODO: database insert / create table!"
}
```

## ðŸ”´ Load user (log in) [maybe]
```
GET /log_in
```

## ðŸ”´ Search for Albums by (Album Name/ Artist /Song) [definitely]
```
GET /query_user_search 
- params: 
    - searchString (string) i.e. "Thriller"
    - searchBy (string) i.e. "album name" (other options: "artist", "song")   
- return top 50 results  
```
Usage: Frontedn `SearchResults` page.

## ðŸ”´ Save album [definitely]
```
POST /save_album_for_user
- Parameters:
    - user_id (integer)
    - album_id (integer)
    - plan_type (string). Options: "past", "present", "future"
- Return (json)
{
    "message": "successfully saved album to user's!"
}
```
- Todo: consider if we wanna also have them just pass in the `username`, `album_name` so that it's easy to display in the log/return message without having to look it back up :P
- This endpoint name was chosen over "save_album" in case we have to add albums to our database using an endpoint with a similar name.
- `user_id`: remember this from signing up!
- `album_id`: i.e. from Frontend "SearchResults" page.
- `plan_type`: i.e. the user selection when they press [Save]

## ðŸ”´ Check if album already saved [maybe]
```
GET /is_album_saved_for_user
- Params:
    - user_id
    - album_id
- Return: (example)
    {
        'past': False
        'present': False
        'future: True
    }
```
Helper function for frontend and/or `POST /save_album_for_user`. Won't let the user select a particular plan to save to if they already saved it there.

## ðŸ”´ Load saved albums [definitely]
```
GET /load_user_saves
- Parameters
    - user_id (integer)
- Returns the 3 tables to display.
- reads all of the info from the one "user_listening" table, but seperates it for ease on the frontend.
{
    "past": [
        "album_id": ...
        "album_name": ...
        (maybe) "album_cover_url": ...

    ],
    "present" : [...],
    "future" : [...]
}
```

# Packages / Dependencies
- mysql
```

```



If running into problems revolving around the backend unable to load dependencies, make sure to run:
