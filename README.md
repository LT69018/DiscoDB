# DiscoDB
This repository contains the code for our database application, "DiscoDB".

The goal is to allow users to search for and save albums to "listening lists", 
similar to how goodreads allows readers to save books they want to read.

## Appearance

    <figcaption>This is how the app appears as of March 30th. The user can type anything in the text box, and we save it, but pressing `Search` doesn't take them anywhere at this moment.</figcaption>

## Pulling the current dataset
Go to this [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1pKdHyqLQyvNPYMsrdXC8M1apf1UDdFR4), download all of the files in the folder (the files are titled as follows: "discogs_20240201_artists_modified", "found_missing_releases_masters", "main_releases_modified", and "recovered_missing_releases_modified"), and download and run the file titled "setup_sql.py". The setup file does not yet exist, but these will be the appropriate steps to follow once it is uploaded.
